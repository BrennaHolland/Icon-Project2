			<p class="intro">Fort Lee, NJ - When Dawn Wooten blew the whistle on a doctor performing unwanted hysterectomies at an ICE detention camp, she didn't just unearth horrific malpractice happening in her workplace. Wooten, who was a practicing
				nurse at the camp, also sparked a national conversation about the state of gynecologic care.</p>

			<p>At the camp, a young woman named Pauline Binam visited the doctor to discuss her irregular periods. Later, during a procedure to remove a mild cyst, she had a fallopian tube removed without her consent, likely ending her ability to ever get
				pregnant.</p>

			<p>The choice to remove Binam's fallopian tube is emblematic of an attitude that is, at times, pervasive in the gynecologic community: that removing women's reproductive organs is the quickest and most effective solution for unwanted
				symptoms.</p>

			<p>A state-wide, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25542564/">Michigan study</a> found that 37.7% of women who had hysterectomies had no prior treatment for their condition before the date of their surgery. In other words, hysterectomies
				were used as a first line of treatment over less invasive measures. </p>

			<p>Hysterectomies, of which there are 500,000 annually in the US, entail the removal of the uterus and, sometimes, the ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix and surrounding structures. Hysterectomies jump-start menopause, end your ability to get
				pregnant and severely limit your ability to produce estrogen.</p>

			<p>Many doctors believe the conditions that most-often lead women to the operating room, do not have effective, alternative treatments. This opinion is reinforced (in a self-proclaimed prophecy kind of way)
				by the fact that the second-most
				common
				surgery performed on women is hysterectomies. By the time they are 60-years-old, one-in-three American women will have undergone a hysterectomy.</p>

					<h4>Uterine Fibroids</h4>
					<img src="uterus.png">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">Uterine fibroids are the most common reason for hysterectomies, accounting for one-third of the national total. Fibroids are non-cancerous growths on the uterus and can range from the size of a pea, to the
						size of a football. For many women, fibroids never cause discomfort and never require treatment. For others, symptoms can be debilitating: heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, pain during sex and low-back pain.

					<h4>Endometriosis</h4>
					<img src="cramps.png">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">Endometriosis is the second most-common reason women get hysterectomies. This condition occurs when endometrial tissue begins to grow outside the uterus and on nearby organs. Symptoms include painful
						periods, heavy bleeding and chronic pelvic pain.</figcaption>

					<h4>Uterine Prolapse</h4>
					<img src="hips.png">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">Uterine prolapse occurs when pelvic floor muscles weaken, allowing the uterus to move from its normal position and into the vagina. Uterine prolapse is often the result of a difficult pregnancy or labor, and
						can be very uncomfortable to live with. Women often feel a sensation of heaviness on their pelvis, or difficulty with urinating and bowel movements.</figcaption>

			<p>For reasons that remain unclear, Black women are two-to-three times more likely to have fibroids, have larger fibroids and have worse symptoms than white women. Recent research suggests there may be a link between chronic stress and
				fibroids, implying generational trauma and racism may be at play here.</p>

			<p>In her book, "Everything Below the Waist: Why Healthcare Needs a Feminist Revolution," Jennifer Block interviewed Tanika Gray, founder of fibroid advocacy group, the White Dress Project. </p>

			<p>"It was just kind of like a way of life when I started listening to women's stories. It was just like, yeah, we got fibroids. Yeah, my mother had a hysterectomy - I'll probably have one too. It just felt wrong," Gray said.</p>

			<p>Women with chronic fibroids are often faced with a terrible choice: live with unwanted symptoms, or get a hysterectomy. What is often left out of the conversation, are the less damaging, alternative treatments.</p>

			<p>A laparoscopic myomectomy - a procedure Gray herself underwent - allows a surgeon to remove fibroids through small incisions, without removing necessary reproductive tissue. </p>
			<p>Although hysterectomies were once considered the most effective treatment for endometriosis, there has been movement within the medical community to focus on procedures that only remove endometrial tissue. </p>
			<p>Uterine prolapse, being essentially a muscle issue, can be improved through pelvic floor strengthening exercises, also known as kegels. </p>
			<p>While there's no doubt that hysterectomies can be the right choice for women who have exhausted their alternative treatment options, too often, we hear about women, like Binam, who were never presented with these alternatives. </p>
